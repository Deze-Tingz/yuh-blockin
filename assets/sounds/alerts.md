Organise the alerts within the app based on the type of alert that mirror what inside the folders at "C:\Users\Deze_Tingz\AndroidStudioProjects\Yuh_Blockin\assets\sounds" the user must be able to change the alerts for Low Normal and High, this should look clean and not interfere with the working parts of the app. Format the labels for the sounds like "Alert 1, Alert 2, etc" Change the alert tile color to match the level of the alert and the relevant animations to match.
