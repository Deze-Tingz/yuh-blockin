You are an expert Flutter and Dart developer. We need to enhance the “Yuh Blockin’” app with country-specific license plate validation, display the corresponding country flag, and allow easy testing of all flags.

**TASKS:**
1. Implement a system that detects the user’s current country via geolocation and restricts license plate input to that country’s format.

2. Display the corresponding country flag next to the user’s license plate on the home screen. The flag should be stored locally for performance and offline availability.

3. Provide a way to test all country flags without relying on actual geolocation. Add a debug or test mode that lets us cycle through all available flags so we can verify the UI for each country.

**DELIVERABLES:**
- Provide the code snippet for the country-specific license plate validation.
- Provide the code snippet to display the appropriate flag next to the license plate.
- Include a simple debug or test mode that allows us to manually switch between all country flags so we can test them easily.

IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS IS A DRASTIC CHANGE SUGGEST CREATING A NEW BRANCH
